My first Discord bot!
The commands folder holds the details for each command

Implemented Commands:
/roll : generates a random number as if you were rolling one or many dice

/reload : reloads a given command so that the bot does not need to be stopped and started when working on a command

/help : messages the user with a list of all the commands available, can also provide specific details on how to use a command

/kick : kicks a user from the server as long as the command user has proper permissions

/ping : The hello world of discord bot commands

Commands to be implemented:
/mute
/unmute
/deafen
/undeafen
